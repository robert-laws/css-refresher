## HTML

Use of semantic HTML is highly recommended. HTML tags help to provide logical and consistent division and sectioning of pages. Many semantic tags also carry important information about the content held within the tags.

### Selection of HTML Semantic Tags

- `<main>`
- `<header>`
- `<footer>`
- `<nav>`
- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<aside>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
